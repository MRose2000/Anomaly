					Hi there, I am Owen! I'm 16 and I am the audio guy for Team Anomaly and Team Nice Dynamite. I was originally part of Team Nice Dynamite but I offered to help Team Anomaly with audio. I found the music that you will hear in the game and I created all of the sound effects that you will hear in the game. I hope you enjoy the game and the way it sounds!
