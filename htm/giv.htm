 <h4>
	GIV is the Governors Institute of Vermont.  We participated in the Governors Institute of Vermont IT&Dm, Information Technology and Digital Media (and Game Design).  It was held at Champlain College.  We learned so many things!  It was a wonderful 9 days, we had so much fun and met so many amazing people!  We would like to thank Shannon and Robin for leading this wonderful camp.  We would like to thank Frank, Evan, Bryan, Marie, Greg, Becky, and Diana.
